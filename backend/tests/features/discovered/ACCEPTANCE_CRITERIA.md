# BDD Test Acceptance Criteria

## Overview
Each BDD scenario must meet specific acceptance criteria to be considered complete and passing. These criteria ensure tests are meaningful, reliable, and provide business value.

## General Acceptance Criteria (All Tests)

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 200ms for API calls
- **WebSocket Latency**: < 50ms for messages
- **Test Execution**: < 30 seconds per scenario
- **Memory Usage**: No memory leaks during test

### Data Integrity
- **State Consistency**: System state matches expected after each step
- **No Side Effects**: Tests must clean up after themselves
- **Idempotency**: Running test multiple times produces same result
- **Isolation**: Tests do not affect each other

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Failures**: Errors handled without crashes
- **Clear Messages**: Error messages are actionable
- **Recovery**: System returns to stable state
- **Logging**: All errors are logged appropriately

- ✓ Single pipeline request (not N requests)
- ✓ Response within 100ms for 100 auctions
- ✓ Memory usage O(n) not O(n²)
- ✓ Invalid JSON entries skipped gracefully
- ✓ Empty result returns [] not null

### WebSocket Features

#### Scenario: Broadcast to specific auction subscribers
**Given** 3 clients subscribed to auction "12345"

**Then** only subscribed clients receive message

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✓ All subscribers receive within 50ms
- ✓ Non-subscribers receive nothing
- ✓ Closed connections are skipped
- ✓ Message order is preserved
- ✓ Large messages (1MB) handled correctly
- ✓ Broadcast completes even if client errors

#### Scenario: Handle authentication with valid token
**Given** AUTH_TOKEN is "valid-token"
**When** client sends authenticate message
**Then** client should be marked authenticated

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✓ Response sent within 100ms
- ✓ RequestId preserved in response
- ✓ Client state updated correctly
- ✓ Invalid tokens rejected immediately
- ✓ Multiple auth attempts handled
- ✓ Connection remains stable

### API Route Features

#### Scenario: Validate auction configuration
**Given** config with invalid strategy
**When** validation runs
**Then** appropriate error returned

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✓ Validation completes within 10ms
- ✓ All invalid fields listed in response
- ✓ HTTP 400 status returned
- ✓ No partial updates on validation failure
- ✓ Clear error messages provided
- ✓ Valid configs pass immediately

#### Scenario: Place bid with proper error mapping
**Given** bid fails with specific error
**When** error response is generated
**Then** correct HTTP status is returned

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✓ Status codes match error types
- ✓ Error details included in response
- ✓ Original error logged server-side
- ✓ Client can parse error type
- ✓ Retryable errors indicated
