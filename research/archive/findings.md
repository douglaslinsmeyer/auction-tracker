# Nellis Auction Backend Communication Analysis

## Summary of Findings

After extensive network monitoring and analysis of nellisauction.com, here are the key findings about how their UI updates from the backend:

### 1. **No Active Real-time Updates Detected**
- The SSE endpoint (`https://sse.nellisauction.com`) returns a 404 error
- No WebSocket connections were observed
- No polling mechanisms detected during monitoring

### 2. **Static Configuration Present**
The site includes configuration for real-time updates but they appear inactive:
- SSE URL configured: `https://sse.nellisauction.com`
- API backend: `https://cargo.prd.nellis.run/api`
- However, these endpoints either return 404 or require authentication

### 3. **Current Architecture**
Based on the network analysis:
- **Frontend**: React/Remix-based application
- **Search**: Algolia search service (index: `nellisauction-prd`)
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics, TikTok Pixel, Sentry error tracking
- **CDN**: Static assets served from their own domain

### 4. **Likely Update Mechanism**
Given the absence of active real-time connections, the site likely uses one of these approaches:
1. **Page Refresh**: Users need to refresh to see updates
2. **Client-side Polling**: May be implemented but not triggered on browse pages
3. **Auction-specific SSE**: SSE might only activate on specific auction item pages with active bidding

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints Discovered
- Main API base: `https://cargo.prd.nellis.run/api`
- All tested endpoints (`/api/auctions`, `/api/bids`, etc.) returned 404 or 401
- Suggests API requires authentication or uses different paths

### SSE Configuration
```javascript
// Found in page configuration:
sseUrl: "https://sse.nellisauction.com"
```
However, direct connection attempts fail with 404.

### Potential Real-time Implementation
The presence of SSE configuration suggests they have infrastructure for real-time updates, but it may be:
- Disabled on browse pages
- Only active during live auctions
- Require authentication tokens
- Use dynamic SSE endpoints per auction

## Recommendations for Our Implementation

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Implement both polling and SSE/WebSocket support
2. **Authentication**: Real-time endpoints likely require auth tokens from cookies/session
3. **Auction-specific Monitoring**: Focus on individual auction pages rather than browse pages
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Always have polling as a fallback when real-time fails

## Next Steps

To fully understand their real-time mechanism:
1. Monitor an active auction page with live bidding
2. Inspect authenticated API calls after login
3. Check for SSE connections with proper authentication headers
4. Monitor during scheduled auction end times for increased activity
