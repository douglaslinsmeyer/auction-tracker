# Phase 4b Progress Report

## Overview
Phase 4b focuses on implementing comprehensive BDD test scenarios using Cucumber and Gherkin syntax.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. BDD Infrastructure Setup ✅
- Fixed module import paths in `world.js` and `hooks.js`
- Configured mock Redis using our custom ioredis mock
- Set up default auth token for tests
- Fixed Gherkin syntax errors in existing feature files
- Created test infrastructure verification feature

### 2. Core Auction Monitoring Feature ✅
- Created comprehensive `core-monitoring.feature` with 9 scenarios:
  - Successfully start monitoring an auction
  - Monitor multiple auctions simultaneously
  - Stop monitoring an auction
  - Cannot monitor the same auction twice
  - Validate auction configuration
  - Recover monitored auctions after restart
  - Handle auction state transitions
  - Handle API errors gracefully
  - Handle invalid auction IDs

### 3. Step Definitions Implementation ✅
- Created `core-monitoring.steps.js` with complete step definitions
- Integrated with test factories (AuctionFactory)
- Mocked nellisApi using sinon
- Aligned with actual API schema requirements
- Fixed method names to match actual auctionMonitor interface

## Key Learnings

### 1. API Schema Alignment
The auction monitoring API expects:
```javascript
{
  config: {
    maxBid: number,
    strategy: 'manual' | 'aggressive' | 'last-second' | 'sniping',
    autoBid: boolean,
    // Optional fields
    incrementAmount: number,
    minBidAmount: number,
    snipeSeconds: number
  },
  metadata: {
    source: 'api' | 'extension' | 'web',
    userAgent: string,
    timestamp: number
  }
}
```

### 2. Service Interface Discovery
- `auctionMonitor.addAuction()` not `startMonitoring()`
- `auctionMonitor.removeAuction()` not `stopMonitoring()`
- `auctionMonitor.getMonitoredAuctions()` returns array
- Check monitoring status via `monitoredAuctions` Map

### 3. Test Organization Benefits
The new test organization with factories and unified mocks has proven valuable:
- Easy to create test data with AuctionFactory
- Consistent Redis mocking across all tests
- Clear separation of concerns in step definitions

## Current Status

### Working Tests
- Basic infrastructure test (3/3 scenarios passing)
- Core monitoring feature partially working (API calls successful)

### Remaining Work
1. Fix remaining assertions in core monitoring tests
2. Implement remaining 14 auction monitoring scenarios
3. Create and implement bidding strategies scenarios (15)
4. Create and implement authentication scenarios (10)
5. Create and implement WebSocket scenarios (10)
6. Create and implement performance/reliability scenarios (36)
7. Create and implement edge cases scenarios (33)
8. Create and implement integration scenarios (20)

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Core Monitoring Tests**
   - Fix storage persistence assertions
   - Add WebSocket message verification
   - Test auction state transitions

2. **Bidding Strategies (High Priority)**
   - Manual bidding scenarios
   - Aggressive auto-bidding
   - Last-second sniping
   - Strategy switching

3. **Authentication (High Priority)**
   - Cookie management
   - Session handling
   - Re-authentication flows

## Recommendations

1. **Run Tests in Isolation**: Some tests are timing out due to the full suite running. Consider:
   - Running features individually during development
   - Adding test timeouts for long-running scenarios
   - Using `--fail-fast` to stop on first failure

2. **Mock External Dependencies**: Continue using sinon to mock:
   - nellisApi responses
   - WebSocket connections
   - Timer-based operations

3. **Leverage Test Factories**: Expand factories for:
   - WebSocket messages
   - API error responses
   - Authentication states

## Summary
Phase 4b is progressing well. The BDD infrastructure is solid, and we have a working pattern for implementing scenarios. The main challenge has been aligning test expectations with actual API schemas and service interfaces, which is now resolved.
