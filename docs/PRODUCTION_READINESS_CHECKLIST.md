## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### Health Checks (All Deployments)
- [ ] Backend health check: `curl http://localhost:3000/health?detailed=true`
- [ ] Dashboard accessible: `curl http://localhost:3001`
- [ ] WebSocket connection working
- [ ] Redis connection established
- [ ] SSL/TLS working (if configured)

### Monitoring (All Deployments)
- [ ] Prometheus scraping metrics: `curl http://localhost:3000/metrics`
- [ ] Grafana dashboards loading
- [ ] Alerts configured and working
- [ ] Logs being generated and rotated
- [ ] SSL certificate monitoring active: `./scripts/ssl-check.sh`

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] Chrome extension can connect
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] Can monitor auctions
- [ ] Bidding strategies functioning
- [ ] SSE connections established
- [ ] Fallback to polling working

---

## üìä Performance Validation

### Load Testing
```bash
# Test with 10 concurrent auctions
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auctions/$i/monitor \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"maxBid": 100, "strategy": "sniping"}'
done

# Check memory usage
docker stats --no-stream
```

### Expected Metrics
#### Self-Hosted Targets
- Memory usage < 256MB per container
- CPU usage < 50% under normal load

- WebSocket connections stable
- SSE connections stable

#### Enterprise Targets
- Memory usage < 512MB per instance
- CPU usage < 30% under normal load

sudo ufw allow 80/tcp    # HTTP
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp   # HTTPS
sudo ufw enable

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend won't start**
   ```bash
   # Check logs
   docker-compose logs -f backend
   
   # Verify Redis connection
   docker-compose exec backend redis-cli -h redis ping
   ```

2. **High memory usage**
   ```bash
   # Check for memory leaks
   docker-compose exec backend node --inspect=0.0.0.0:9229 src/index.js
   
   # Analyze heap dump
   docker-compose exec backend kill -USR2 $(pgrep node)
   ```

3. **SSL issues**
   ```bash
   # Check certificate
   openssl x509 -in ssl/cert.pem -text -noout
   
   # Test SSL handshake
   openssl s_client -connect localhost:443
   ```

---

## üìã Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Stop current deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml down

# Restore from backup
./scripts/backup.sh restore /path/to/backup.tar.gz

# Start previous version
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Feature Flag Rollback
```bash
# Disable problematic feature
docker-compose exec backend redis-cli SET "features:USE_SSE" "false"
```
